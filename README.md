## Course description:
   Computational Geometry is about design and analysis of efficient algorithms for geometric problems, typically in low dimensions (2,3,..). These are needed in many application domains, such as geographic information systems, computer graphics, or geometric modeling. The lecture introduces important design paradigms for geometric algorithms. Its goal is to make students familiar with the important techniques and results in computational geometry, and to enable them to attack theoretical and practical problems in various application domains.

Covered topics include convex hulls, line sweep algorithms, Delaunay triangulation, randomized incremental constructions, trapezoidal decomposition, Voronoi diagrams, pesudotriangulation, linear programming, smallest enclosing balls, arrangements, Davenport-Schinzel sequences, motion planning, and epsilon nets.
